## Watch IMU Data Endpoint Fix

### Issue Resolution
*Fixed on 2025-08-16T06:28:00Z*

#### Problem Identified
The watch IMU integration was failing because the watch HTTP server was missing the `/data` endpoint that the PC recorder application tries to access to retrieve IMU data. This resulted in:
- Watch indicating successful connection but recordings producing empty IMU folders
- HTTP 404 errors when PC code attempted to fetch data from the missing `/data` endpoint
- Watch correctly recording IMU data to local CSV files but unable to serve data via HTTP

#### Root Cause
- **Watch-side**: The [`HttpServerService.kt`](watchimurecorder/src/main/java/com/example/watchimurecorder/services/HttpServerService.kt:335) only implemented `/ping`, `/start`, `/stop`, and `/status` endpoints
- **PC-side**: The PC application's `_retrieve_imu_data()` method tries to fetch data from the missing `/data` endpoint
- **Result**: HTTP 404 error, no data retrieved, empty IMU folders created despite successful recording

#### Solution Implemented
Added the missing `/data` endpoint to [`HttpServerService.kt`](watchimurecorder/src/main/java/com/example/watchimurecorder/services/HttpServerService.kt) with the following functionality:

1. **New `/data` Endpoint**: Added GET endpoint that reads the most recent CSV file from the watch's recordings directory
2. **CSV to JSON Conversion**: Implemented `convertCsvToJson()` method that:
   - Reads CSV files with proper metadata handling
   - Converts sensor data to JSON format expected by PC application
   - Handles accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer data
   - Maintains timestamp precision and data integrity
3. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for file access and data conversion
4. **Updated Endpoint List**: Modified error message to include the new `/data` endpoint

#### Technical Changes
- **Import Added**: `java.io.File` import for file operations
- **Endpoint Routing**: Added `/data` case to the HTTP request routing logic
- **Data Processing**: New methods for reading CSV files and converting to JSON format
- **Response Format**: JSON array of sensor readings with proper field mapping

#### API Enhancement
The watch now provides a complete API with the following endpoints:

| Endpoint | Method | Description | Response Format |
|----------|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| `/start` | GET | Start IMU data recording | Plain text status |
| `/stop` | GET | Stop IMU data recording | Plain text status |
| `/status` | GET | Get current recording status | JSON status object |
| `/ping` | GET | Health check endpoint | "pong" |
| `/data` | GET | **NEW**: Retrieve recorded IMU data | JSON array of sensor readings |

#### Data Format
The new `/data` endpoint returns JSON in the following format:
```json
[
  {
    "timestamp": 1642680000000000,
    "accel_x": 0.1,
    "accel_y": -9.8,
    "accel_z": 0.2,
    "gyro_x": 0.01,
    "gyro_y": 0.02,
    "gyro_z": -0.01,
    "mag_x": 45.2,
    "mag_y": 12.3,
    "mag_z": -8.7
  }
]
```

#### Next Steps
1. Rebuild and reinstall the watch app with the updated [`HttpServerService.kt`](watchimurecorder/src/main/java/com/example/watchimurecorder/services/HttpServerService.kt)
2. Test the complete stillness recorder workflow with PC application
3. Verify that IMU data is now successfully retrieved and saved by the PC recorder

This fix resolves the core issue preventing successful IMU data synchronization between the watch app and PC recorder application.

#### Build Configuration Fix
*Fixed on 2025-08-16T06:32:00Z*

**Issue**: After implementing the `/data` endpoint fix, the watch app failed to compile with Gradle build errors:
- "Unable to find Gradle tasks to build: [:watchimurecorder]" in Android Studio
- Kotlin compilation errors with type mismatch in `mapOf()` calls

**Root Causes**:
1. **Duplicate Module Declaration**: The [`settings.gradle.kts`](settings.gradle.kts) file contained a duplicate `include(":watchimurecorder")` line
2. **Type Inference Issues**: The `mapOf()` call in `convertCsvToJson()` method mixed Long and Double types without explicit type declaration

**Solutions Applied**:
1. **Fixed Gradle Configuration**: Removed duplicate `include(":watchimurecorder")` line from [`settings.gradle.kts`](settings.gradle.kts)
2. **Fixed Type Declaration**: Added explicit `mapOf<String, Any>()` type parameter and parentheses around values to ensure proper type casting

**Build Verification**: The watch module now compiles successfully with `./gradlew :watchimurecorder:assemble` completing without errors.

The watch app is now ready for installation and testing with the new `/data` endpoint functionality.

## Wear OS Side Swipe Menu Implementation

### Overview
*Added on 2025-08-16T10:59:00Z*

A side swipe menu with shutdown functionality has been implemented for the Wear OS app to provide easy access to app shutdown without using hardware buttons.

### Features

#### Side Swipe Gesture
- **Swipe from Left Edge**: Swipe right from the left edge of the screen to reveal the menu
- **Smooth Animation**: Animated menu appearance with content sliding effect
- **Touch Outside to Close**: Tap anywhere outside the menu to close it
- **Visual Feedback**: Semi-transparent overlay indicates menu state

#### Shutdown Functionality
- **Safe Shutdown**: Properly stops all services before app termination
- **Service Cleanup**: Stops IMU data recording and HTTP server gracefully
- **Progress Indication**: Shows shutdown process with appropriate delays
- **Force Exit**: Uses `exitProcess(0)` to ensure complete app termination

### Technical Implementation

#### Components Created
- **`SwipeToRevealMenu.kt`**: Composable component implementing the swipe gesture and menu UI
- **`ic_power_off.xml`**: Power button icon drawable resource for the shutdown button
- **Shutdown Method**: Added `shutdownApp()` method to MainActivity for safe app termination

#### UI Design
- **Menu Width**: 80dp wide menu panel on the left side
- **Dark Background**: Semi-transparent black background (90% opacity)
- **Red Shutdown Button**: Circular red button with power icon
- **Material Design**: Follows Wear OS design guidelines with proper spacing

#### Gesture Handling
- **Drag Detection**: Uses `detectDragGestures` to handle swipe interactions
- **Threshold-based**: Menu stays open if swipe exceeds 20% of screen width
- **Smooth Transitions**: Animated content offset and menu visibility
- **Touch Boundaries**: Prevents accidental activation with proper gesture thresholds

### Integration

#### MainActivity Changes
- **SwipeToRevealMenu Wrapper**: Main UI content wrapped in SwipeToRevealMenu component
- **Shutdown Callback**: Integrated shutdown functionality with service cleanup
- **Import Updates**: Added necessary imports for system exit functionality

#### Service Management
The shutdown process includes:
1. **Stop Active Recording**: Halts IMU data collection if in progress
2. **Stop HTTP Server**: Gracefully shuts down the network server
3. **Unbind Services**: Properly disconnects from bound services
4. **Stop Services**: Terminates foreground services
5. **Exit Application**: Forces complete app termination

### User Experience

#### Usage Instructions
1. **Access Menu**: Swipe right from the left edge of the watch screen
2. **Shutdown App**: Tap the red power button in the revealed menu
3. **Confirmation**: App will safely shut down all services and exit
4. **Close Menu**: Tap outside the menu area to close without action

#### Visual Feedback
- **Menu Animation**: Smooth slide-in animation when menu appears
- **Content Offset**: Main content slides right to reveal menu underneath
- **Button States**: Clear visual indication of interactive elements
- **Progress Display**: Shutdown process provides appropriate user feedback

### Files Created/Modified

#### New Files
- `watchimurecorder/src/main/java/com/example/watchimurecorder/presentation/SwipeToRevealMenu.kt`
- `watchimurecorder/src/main/res/drawable/ic_power_off.xml`

#### Modified Files
- `watchimurecorder/src/main/java/com/example/watchimurecorder/presentation/MainActivity.kt`: Added SwipeToRevealMenu integration and shutdown functionality

### Build and Testing

#### Compilation Status
- **Build Successful**: All components compile without errors
- **Gradle Build**: `./gradlew :watchimurecorder:build` completes successfully
- **Resource Validation**: Drawable resources properly configured for Wear OS

#### Testing Verification
- **Gesture Recognition**: Swipe gestures properly detected and handled
- **Menu Animation**: Smooth transitions and visual feedback working correctly
- **Shutdown Process**: Safe service termination and app exit functionality verified

This implementation provides users with an intuitive way to safely shut down the watch app without relying on hardware buttons or system navigation, ensuring proper cleanup of all background services and data recording processes.
